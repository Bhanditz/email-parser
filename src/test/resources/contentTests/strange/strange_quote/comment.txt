4_gmail_receive_q1_FAILED 

Strange quote formatting which fails to parse

5_gmail_send_q2_QUOTE_ATE

After replying on prev message gmail web client just ate designation of that quote!
Should find a way why it happened and what to do with it (parse of leave).

UPD: seems it fixed. (I guess after replacement CRLF with LF)
